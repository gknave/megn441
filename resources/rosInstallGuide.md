# ROS2 Installation Guide

This is an overall guide for install ROS2 Humble on a computer, for editing and testing packages for your ROS bot. I have tested these on Windows and Ubuntu 24.04. Please share feedback on this document, so it can continue to be improved.

## Option 1: Docker

Docker is my recommended option. Docker containers are lightweight, isolated development environments that contain all the software you need in a tidy package. They can only connect to the rest of your files if you give them permission. In my description below, I have you hook up a local directory

- *For Windows machines*: Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (wsl), following the instructions here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- If using a Mac, no need for WSL. MacOS is a Unix system, so just about all of the functionality you would need from WSL is there behind the scenes using `Terminal`. Can just start by installing Docker Desktop, as below.

- Download and install Docker Desktop: [Docker Desktop Install Page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- I have included my `Dockerfile`, which can be used to build a ROS workspace and configure it for yourself.
- To build the Dockerfile, use the following. It will grab the file named `Dockerfile` and create an image called `ros2-dev:latest`
  
  ```bash
  docker build -t ros2-dev .
  ```

- You've now created an image! To run a container from this image, use:
  
  ```bash
  docker run -it ros2-dev
  ```

- Sometimes, I want to run multiple terminals in the same container, then I use: `docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash`. The container name is randomly generated each time. If I'm only running one container, I use tab to autocomplete the container name. Otherwise, `docker ps` shows you the list of currently running containers.
- To run docker interactively with GUI integration and a local folder with a path `/path/to/local_dir/` such as `/c/Users/username/Documents/docker_ws`, use:

  ```bash
  docker run -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v /path/to/local_dir:/mnt/docker_ws \
    -w /mnt/docker_ws
    -e DISPLAY \
    -e WAYLAND_DISPLAY \
    -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR \
    -e PULSE_SERVER \
    ros2-dev:latest
  ```

- The `-v` flag lets you connect a local directory to a directory within the Docker container, giving access to local files, etc. I use `/mnt/docker_ws` as my location with Docker, but call it what you want! The Docker container will lose its memory upon deletion, but if you connect it to a local directory, you will keep any files modified there.
- The `-w` flag starts the terminal in your `/mnt/docker_ws` workspace.
- The `-e` flags connect the container to the graphical interface of your computer. Haven't tested on a Mac yet. Reach out with feedback!
- I have included this command in the attached `startDocker.sh` script. You'll need to edit the path in this file to match your path on your computer.
- The long `docker run` command above needs some different flags in Linux, so I've also included `startDockerLinux.sh` for those devices.

## Option 2: VirtualBox Install

Virtual machines are heavier than Docker, which is why Docker is my preferred tool here. However, they do give you full desktop functionality, which many may enjoy. Below are the instructions for using a Virtual Machine with VirtualBox, but many virtual machine tools exist.

- Download Ubuntu 22.04 `.iso` file from [https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)
- Download VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). You will want the platform packages for a Windows (or MacOS) host, and the VirtualBox Extension Pack.
- Need to set up `sudo` rights for user. In the Terminal, run the following commands:

  ``` bash
  su -
  usermod -a -G sudo vboxuser
  ```

- Then, restart the virtualbox
- Need to configure copy-paste as well, go to `Machine/Settings/General/Features`, and check the `shared clipboard` option. This lets you copy and paste between Windows and your Virtual Machine.
- Useful to set up a shared folder that both Windows and the Virtual Machine can access.

### Installing ROS2

- After installing the virtual machine, install ROS2 Humble, using the docs below. Just about anything you need can be installed via apt, using `sudo apt install ros-humble-`something
- Humble install docs: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)
- To start, you'll need to install both `ros-humble-desktop` and `ros-dev-tools`
- After install ROS, you'll need to `source` the ROS installation anytime you want to run `ros2` commands with:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

- It's a good idea to add this to the end of your `.bashrc` file, which is what runs anytime your BASH terminal opens. To do that, you can just run:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
