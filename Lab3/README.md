# Lab 3: Robot Arm Pick and Place

## Lab Overview

In Lab 3, we will park our robots and get the arm working to pick and place colored blocks into a stack. You'll progressively step further back in arm control, starting by directly controlling the arm, then sending forward angles to a topic, and finally sending a desired end-effector position to the robot.

By the end of this lab, you'll be able to:

- Interface with the Rosbot's internal controller
- Write your own ROS2 messages and services
- Control an arm using forward kinematic commands
- Implement analytical inverse kinematics to send a gripper to a given position/orientation
- Use computer vision to detect a block using the depth camera.

### Lab Procedure

0. **Prepare the bot**: Create a clean workspace on the robot for your team for this project. Something like: `a9_ws_lab3` for team A9. You won't need any of the base ros2_ws packages - those are all in ~/ros2_ws on the bot, and they get sourced automatically on the robot's startup. `bringup.launch.py` also gets launched automatically. We have also included both the Orbbec and sllidar packages there. In your new package, include a copy of the `rosbot` (or similar) packages from previous labs in the `src` folder, including your launch files in `a9_ws_lab3/rosbot/launch`. Place all configuration files (rviz, sensor_params, etc.) in `a9_ws_lab3/rosbot/config`. Be sure these are both added to the `share` directory in the `setup.py` file, as you did in the first lab. Copy the base `rosbot_arm` and `rosbot_msgs` packages from `lab3_ws/src/` in this repository into `a9_ws_lab3/src/` on the robot. *Also, be sure that you get any files from labs 1, 2 off of your prior robots, as we will be removing old workspaces after the first week of Lab 3*

   **Prepare your team**: Talk through how collaboration will work on this lab. You've worked on two labs to this point. What worked well for collaboration in the past? What didn't work well? How will you share files? How will you divide tasks? If you need to come in outside of lab hours, what days/times work well?

1. **Explore direct control of the rosbot arm**: We have provided a node in `rosbot_arm` called `arm_test`, that can be used to explore control of the arm directly. By setting `main(mode='direct')`, you can edit the list of (id, pulse) pairs called `targets` that is provided in the file, to test the effect of each joint. The joints of the arm are given ids=1-5, while the gripper is given id=10. For these servos, a timed pulse between 0 and 1000 ms corresponds to an angle from -120 to 120 degrees, and commands are sent as pulses. The only limits you need to pay close attention to are on joint 2. **Keep the pulse width between 125 and 775 for joint 2**, to protect the screen and the arm. Note that in `arm_test`, commands are sent to the on-board STM microcontroller using the `Board` class defined in the `ros_robot_controller_sdk` node. When you write your own arm_control node later, you can reference this node. To send commands to the arm, you can use the function `bus_servo_set_position(duration, targets)`, and you can read positions with `bus_servo_read_position(id)`. For now, just change the variables in `targets` and see what the robot does!
2. **Write your own ROS2 messages and service**: Next, come up with a plan as a team for how you'd like to send messages about the arm between the `arm_control` and `IK_node` nodes: its forward positions, gripper control, and target positions for inverse kinematics. You'll choose your own topic names and write your own message types for these. Message types are surprisingly straightforward to write. Use [this tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Custom-ROS2-Interfaces.html) to help you get started. You can use the `rosbot_msgs` template, but you will need to update the `CMakeLists.txt` file with your own message types. Also, create a service type for the robot for the service described in the next step.
3. **Write the backend arm_control node**: Write a node that takes your custom forward command ROS messages and sends those commands to the arm. This node should also include a service, as described in [this tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Service-And-Client.html), to send current angle information from the board. To test this `arm_control` node, you can use the `arm_test` forward mode, although you will need to do a bit of work to configure the publisher to your message type.
4. **Write the inverse kinematics node**: Work out the inverse kinematics of your arm, given its end-effector xyz location and local roll/pitch. For our pick and place goals, the local pitch angle is -90 degrees, while the roll angle will be whatever it needs to be to grasp the block. Test your inverse kinematics node on some example configurations to be sure that it works as expected. Test whether your inverse kinematics returns realistic angles and send a warning if the request is not okay. You can send a warning message type with `get_logger().warn('message')`. The logger has five priority levels (of increasing severity): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.
5. **Use opencv to identify blocks using the depth cam**: Further instructions to come.
6. **Write one more node to tell the robot how to stack the blocks**: I recommend putting this in your `rosbot` or `rosbot_arm` package. You will need to modify your `setup.py` to tell it about your new node. In this node, you'll send requests and messages to the other nodes to identify the block locations, pick them up, and place them 20 cm to the right of the robot on the ground. Stack the blocks with red on the bottom, then green, then blue.

## Lab Grading

The grading of each lab is based 50\% on the successful completion of the lab. For this lab, that 50\% breaks down into:

- 10\% - Write your own messages/services
- 10\% - Demonstrate topic-based control of the arm
- 10\% - Demonstrate correct inverse kinematics of the arm
- 10\% - Successfully stack blocks with the arm
- 10\% - Demonstrate autonomous pick and place of the three blocks into a stack.

### Lab Report Guidelines

The guidelines below will be used in grading your lab report. Be sure to include everything that the guidelines below mention for full credit!

#### 1. Problem Statement

- Write a succinct 1-3 sentence description of the goals of this lab.

#### 2. Methods

- Describe the key equations used to calculate the inverse kinematics of the arm.

#### 3. Results

- Describe how the RGBD camera represents its data.
- Include a video of your robot demonstrating the lab grading goals. A video of autonomous pick and place should demonstrate all of the other pieces, and if you don't quite make it there, then you can demonstrate as many of the other parts as possible.
- Explain how your robot's arm control works: detailing which messages are sent to which nodes, and what values are being sent.

#### 4. Conclusions

- Discuss what your team's biggest lessons learned are from this lab.
